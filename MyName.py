# Create a new (local) branch
# Optionally VCS/Git/Push to test you can cause your local branch
#     to be created also on the upstream repository at github
# Add a print statement to this file below, save, test
# VCS/GIT/Commit... (to your local repository)
#   Enter a meaningful commit message!!!!
#   At this point your change is committed to your local branch
# VCS/GIT/Push...   (your changes to the upstream repo)
#   Note, "Commit & Push" is an option on Commit...
#   Now your change is replicated on your branch at github.com
# VCS/GIT/Create Pull Request...

# wait for a github repo administrator to merge your branch
#    to the upstream repo's master branch

# When that's done, your change is merged onto the master branch at github.com,
# so others can pull it as well.
# BUT your local repository's master branch doesn't know about it yet

# Change PyCharm to the master branch
# VCS/GIT/Pull...
# Now the master branch in your local repository is up to date with your change
# and everybody else can get it too!
